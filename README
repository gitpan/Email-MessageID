NAME
    Email::MessageID - Generate world unique message-ids.

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::MessageID;

      my $mid = Email::MessageID->new;

      print "Message-ID: $mid\x0A\x0D";

DESCRIPTION
    Message-ids are optional, but highly recommended, headers that identify
    a message uniquely. This software generates a unique message-id.

  Methods
    new
          my $mid = Email::MessageID->new;

          my $new_mid = Email::MessageID->new( host => $myhost );

        This class method constructs an Email::Address object containing a
        unique message-id. You may specify custom "host" and "user"
        parameters.

        By default, the "host" is generated from "Sys::Hostname::hostname".

        By default, the "user" is generated using "Time::HiRes"'s
        "gettimeofday" and the process ID.

        Using these values we have the ability to ensure world uniqueness
        down to a specific process running on a specific host, and the exact
        time down to six digits of microsecond precision.
